Mai bhi tujhe flowers laane k bahane leopard ke hote hue bhejta raha magar ab accha hi hai ghar se hi dekh rahi ho", "Now plug in your earphones check the volume and click the button below. Do not forget to press F11 on keyboard. I will wait for you to do all this.................................................................................................",

            "Human life is interesitng. We come in this world alone and leave alone. But the people who we share our lives with make it worth living. I want to be the person who gives you immense joy, love, care and respect. Love is not something that you can express in words. Love is something that is felt with the heart. I barely talk to anyone without spending much time with him/her but the day i saw you jaan i heard something from within me that said you are the one i wanted in my life. You are the most precious in my life. The longest distance ever is a step away from touching your face. The most annoying situation is missing to see your smile and the most painful of all is not loving you daily. This day holds a special place for me, I am not with you now but I want to spend all your birthdays by your side doing nothing but holding your hands Siddhi. I hope you are as happy as you should be today and always. Happy birthday my darling.",
             "Font accha hai na, but less beautiful than your handwriting. I wish mera bhi itna accha hota. Hahahahahahahaha",

             "All this was made so that you can see this on your day, i am happy you finally saw what i created for you",
